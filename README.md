To help my friend's plant get light every morning, I built an automatic blind on a timer using arduino UNO, a real time clock chip, some stepper motors, balsa wood, styrofoam, paper, duck tape, and hot glue. You get the idea :)

This program reads the time off of an oscilating crystal time chip and will open the blinds at 6:30am every morning, closing in the evening at 7. Stepper motors are used to drive the setup, and are coupled to the blinds'shafts. This is supported by a small shelf that is attached to the wall, under which electronics can be hidden from view. 


Possible future updates 
- include an astronomical function to adjust sunrise and sunset timers according to the gregorian calendar
- IR control
- state control
- mycroft home integration
